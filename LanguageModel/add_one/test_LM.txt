Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__ It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__ It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__ It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__ I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__ Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__ Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . __eou__ Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . __eou__
Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__ Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security .

It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . __eou__

During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . __eou__ If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__ If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? __eou__ The insurance policy protects us . __eou__ Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? __eou__ It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . __eou__

Enjoy the rest of your day . __eou__
What are your terms of sale ? __eou__ The price quoted is for CIF . __eou__ My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . __eou__ Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . __eou__ Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . __eou__ Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . __eou__
I haven't received my credit card bill yet . __eou__ Which credit card are you speaking of ? __eou__ My Master Card . __eou__ We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ I never got it . __eou__ Your bill was mailed already . __eou__ What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill ? __eou__ If you haven't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office . __eou__ Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault ? __eou__ If that's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake . __eou__ Thanks for everything . __eou__ Don't mention it .

Your total comes to $ 36.78 . __eou__ Put it on my VISA . __eou__ There ’ s a problem with your card . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ I believe it was declined . __eou__ You ’ re kidding me ! __eou__ Do you have another card I could try ? __eou__ I only have one card . __eou__ Do you have cash , perhaps ? __eou__ I don ’ t have any cash on me . __eou__ You ’ re not going to be able to take these items today . __eou__ I ’ ll be back tomorrow . __eou__
I need to go to the ATM . __eou__ So , why don ’ t you ? __eou__ I have no idea how to use the ATM . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ This will be my first time using an ATM . __eou__ I can help you with that . __eou__ Explain to me how to use it . __eou__ Just put your card into the machine . __eou__ Now what do I do ? __eou__ Then you need to type in your PIN . __eou__ Now what ? __eou__ Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it . __eou__

Can I help you with something ? __eou__ I need to cancel one of my accounts . __eou__ Is there a problem with it ? __eou__ I don ’ t need it anymore . __eou__ What would you like to do with all the money in this account ? __eou__ Just transfer it over to my remaining account . __eou__ I can do that . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ Do you want to take any money out ? __eou__ Not today . __eou__ It ’ s going to take a moment for me to cancel your account . __eou__ That ’ s fine . Take your time . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I would like to cancel one of my accounts . __eou__ Is there a problem with your account ? __eou__ I only need one . __eou__ What about all your money in that account ? __eou__ Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__ I appreciate it . __eou__ Would you like to make a withdrawal ? __eou__ That ’ s all for today . __eou__ I ’ ll just cancel your account right now . __eou__ I greatly appreciate your help . __eou__
I would like to open an account please . __eou__ Do you have any form of ID ? __eou__ I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license . __eou__ Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license . __eou__ OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service __eou__ OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back . __eou__
Which services offered by your band do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
I ’ Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__ I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . __eou__ That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . __eou__ I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . __eou__ I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__ That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__ Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk __eou__
So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? __eou__ It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . __eou__ Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__ I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? __eou__ You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . __eou__ But what if I need my money suddenly ? __eou__ The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . __eou__ Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__ Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot __eou__ OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . __eou__
I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please . __eou__ Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ? __eou__ How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ? __eou__ That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though . __eou__ Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty ! __eou__ Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ? __eou__ Yes I do; here is my account number . __eou__ For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ? __eou__ 3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please . __eou__ Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ? __eou__
I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please . __eou__ May I see your passbook . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ This is a sizable sum . Is there any reason you are closing your account with us Mr . Lee ? __eou__ I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . __eou__ I see . Well for this amount I will have to get my manager ’ s approval . __eou__ No problem . I ’ ll wait over there . __eou__ Thank you . This should only be a few minutes . If you would like , there is coffee by those sofas over there . __eou__ No , thanks . Coffee makes me wired and I will be nervous enough carrying all that cash . __eou__
Good morning , miss . __eou__ Good morning , sir . __eou__ Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? __eou__ Right here , how can i help you today , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please . __eou__ Do you have an account this bank , sir ? __eou__ Yes , here is my account number . __eou__ May i please see ID ? __eou__ Sure , here is my passport , by the way what is the rate today ? __eou__ Today's rate is 2.57 Singapore dollars for 1 US dollar , here is your money , sir.Please count it and sign your name here . __eou__ Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ? __eou__ You can cash them here , how much do you want to cash ? __eou__ 900 dollars . __eou__ How would you like it ? __eou__ I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ? __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__ Thank you , have a nice day . __eou__ Thank you , have a good day . __eou__
Hey honey , how was your day ? __eou__ It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . __eou__ Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ Not in a million years ! __eou__
Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . __eou__ Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? __eou__ Currencies . __eou__ Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? __eou__ It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! __eou__ I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? __eou__ You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! __eou__ Last night ? __eou__ Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ __eou__ You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . __eou__ I have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . __eou__ I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . __eou__ I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? __eou__ Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . __eou__ Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ A company account . I need to pay a bill . __eou__ Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ I have all the information in this folder . __eou__ Well . You ’ Ve come prepared.You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now .

Hello , Sir , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? __eou__ It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . __eou__ That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! __eou__

I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? __eou__ For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__ That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? __eou__ Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__ So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__ We do value your business .

I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__ I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! __eou__ Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__ yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__ Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? __eou__ I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! __eou__
Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? __eou__ You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . __eou__ It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . __eou__ Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe __eou__ What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . __eou__ That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it . __eou__
I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__ It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__ I understand , Ma'am . __eou__ And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__ Well . __eou__ You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . __eou__ Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . __eou__
I ’ d like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? __eou__ Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents . __eou__ I have the driver ’ s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ? __eou__ Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok . __eou__ What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? __eou__ You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
You won't believe what just happened . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I went down to change some money , right ? __eou__ Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? __eou__ I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . __eou__ Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? __eou__ Not today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__ Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__ I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__ Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__ So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__ That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? __eou__
I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account . __eou__ Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ? __eou__ Sure ? __eou__ Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__ You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? __eou__ Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t __eou__ Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__ Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__ Well , welcome to the team . __eou__
Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__ And do you have any questions ? __eou__ No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__ I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__ Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__ I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . __eou__ I can accept that . __eou__ Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__ Even my health insurance ? __eou__ Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__ I have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__ Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ What are bar vouchers ? __eou__ Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__ So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? __eou__ Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__ I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__ I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . __eou__
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . __eou__
I ’ d like to have this cashed , please . __eou__ Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How would you like it ? __eou__ Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please . __eou__ Ok , here you are . __eou__

What are you business hours ? __eou__ 10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . __eou__ Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? __eou__ At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . __eou__ But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . __eou__ Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . __eou__ One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , __eou__ Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . __eou__
I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan . __eou__ How much would you like to borrow ? __eou__ A thousand dollars . __eou__ Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems . __eou__ What ’ s the current interest rate ? __eou__ Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ? __eou__
So you've been attending night classes for a while now . Do you feel it's helping you ? __eou__ Yes , furthering my education is already bringing about positive results in my workplace as it has boosted my confidence.As well the tutoring system my school employs offers courses uniquely suite __eou__ Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . __eou__ As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . __eou__ That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . __eou__ They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . __eou__
Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? __eou__ We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . __eou__ What ’ s the result ? __eou__ We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . __eou__ That seems very impressive . Good work ! __eou__ Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . __eou__
I ’ d like to open a current account . __eou__ Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID Please . __eou__ Here your are . I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account . __eou__ Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . __eou__ I see . How do I draw money from my news then . __eou__
Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . __eou__ Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? __eou__ Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . __eou__ Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? __eou__ A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs __eou__ Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? __eou__ A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . __eou__
Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c __eou__ What are you basing this information on ? __eou__ First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . __eou__ Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . __eou__ I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . __eou__ Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . __eou__ I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . __eou__ And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__ It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__ My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . __eou__
You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . __eou__ I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . __eou__ As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . __eou__ Does this title come with an increase in salary ? __eou__ Yes , it does . __eou__ Can you give me the specifics ? __eou__ Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . __eou__ That sounds fair . __eou__
Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . __eou__ Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . __eou__ How long was she employed with your company ? __eou__ She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . __eou__ Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? __eou__ She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
good morning . How can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to open a new account . __eou__ have you filled out an application form ? __eou__ yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? __eou__ yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? __eou__ yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__ that's very convenient . __eou__ it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__ yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? __eou__ the maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__ is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__ yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__ that's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__ they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome . __eou__
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . __eou__ Ok , I'll get this rate right away . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
